# Customer Segmentation (Clustering)

This project is for the purpose of technical test for Eduwork / Upscale Company. The writer's been tasked to make a customer segmentation based on the behaviour of the customer's data. The data itself is not provided by the company, alas the writer took a dataset from Kaggle following the conditions tasked by the company. The link to the dataset is : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mashlyn/online-retail-ii-uci

The project itself is about Customer Segmentation using a Machine Learning Model which is Clustering. After doing the necessary process like Data Cleaning, EDA, Preprocess, etc, the Model making for the Clustering begin. The Clustering in this case is using K-means with the number of optimal K being 3 (it means that there are 3 groups segmented by the behaviour of the Customer's data). The details can be seen on the notebook itself, along with the analysis.
